goals:

- engine/editor for plÂ¢tfarmer-style games

notes:

- instead of the infinite chunk world, we could make it so entities are placed arbitrarily
  in the world and you can draw on them. so an infinite world is a bunch of entities
  - and then layers are easy - entities
  - we have to figure out how to load the entities when they're needed
    - chunks with lists of entities that cover the chunk? + entities/<id>.plc_entity
