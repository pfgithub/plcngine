goals:

- engine/editor for plÂ¢tfarmer-style games

notes:

- instead of the infinite chunk world, we could make it so entities are placed arbitrarily
  in the world and you can draw on them. so an infinite world is a bunch of entities
- and then layers are easy - entities
- we have to figure out how to load the entities when they're needed
- something to think about
